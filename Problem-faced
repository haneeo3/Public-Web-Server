## Problems Faced & Solutions

### 1. Using Git Bash with chmod
- **Problem:** `'chmod' is not recognized as an internal or external command`
- **Cause:** Git Bash on Windows doesn’t handle `chmod` like Linux.  
- **Solution:** Switched to **PowerShell**, which allows SSH without needing `chmod`.

### 2. SSH command issues
- **Problem:** `ssh: Could not resolve hostname your_public_ip`
- **Cause:** Used a placeholder or private IP instead of the public IPv4.  
- **Solution:** Use the actual public IPv4: `44.199.195.154`.

### 3. Bash `!` error when pasting HTML
- **Problem:** `bash: !: event not found`
- **Cause:** Bash interprets `!` as a history expansion character.  
- **Solution:** Typed HTML manually inside `nano` or created a self-contained HTML file.

### 4. Using Nginx on Amazon Linux 2
- **Problem:** `Failed to start nginx.service: Unit nginx.service not found`
- **Cause:** Nginx is not installed by default on Amazon Linux 2.  
- **Solution:** Installed **Apache (`httpd`)**, which is standard:

```bash
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
